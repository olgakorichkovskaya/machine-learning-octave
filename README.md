# Machine learning in Octave/Matlab: typical machine learning algorithms ##

###### Ex1:  Linear regression with one variable 
###### Ex2:    
###### Ex5: Regularized Linear Regression and Bias vs. Variance
   1. Regularized Linear Regression (cost function, gradient): y=theta0+ theta1*x1 (dimention=1)
   2. Bias-variance tradeoff: plot training and test errors on a learning curve to diagnose bias-variance problems (use different amount of testing data m:=1:m)
   Indicator of variance is gab between training and test errors cureve.
   3. Move to Polynomial regression: use biger, dimention=8: y=theta0+ theta1*x1 +...+theta8*x1^8
   4. Adjusting the regularization parameter lambda (0..100)
   5. Find best lambda automatically
